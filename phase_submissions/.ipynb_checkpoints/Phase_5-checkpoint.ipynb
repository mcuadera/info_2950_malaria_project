    "Malaria still poses a major impact on world health, with an estimated 229 million clinical cases occurring in 2019. An important component in malaria transmission is temperature, as both the Plasmodium parasite and the main mosquito vector, Anopheles species mosquitoes, are sensitive to it. Although the majority of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa and in parts of Asia, climate change and increased globalization may cause this disease to spread further. Predicting which countries are at risk for higher numbers of malaria cases is essential for proactively providing public health support. In analyzing country variables such as average temperature, GDP PPP and region, we hope to create a model that predicts the risk of high numbers of malaria infections in a given country."

    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why were these datasets created?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets on malaria incidences, cases and deaths were created by the World Health Organization to better understand the threat of malaria in observed countries. Observations of trends in the data can assist in the WHO’s efforts to eradicate the disease. We combined these three datasets to observe trends in malaria incidence, case number and deaths by country and by year. These trends may reveal insights about the spread of the disease, and pinpoint areas where malaria incidence has declined to allow further investigation into these places. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the World Bank dataset, it was created to \"identify effective public and private actions, set goals and targets, monitor progress and evaluate impacts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth surface temperature dataset, which was obtained in Kaggle, was created to understand the trends in global temperatures with respect to finding evidence for climate change. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Who created the datasets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Health Organization funded the dataset, which is an organization under the direction of the United Nations. The World Bank dataset was created by the World Bank, United Nations Population Division, and US Census Bureau. The Earth surface temperature dataset was compiled by Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Who funded the creation of the datasets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The WHO is funded largely by Member States and UN organizations. \n",
    "The World Bank is capitally funded by member countries/organizations. \n",
    "The Earth surface temperature data is fully funded through charitable contributions from unrestricted grants from donor organizations, as well as the U.S. Department of Energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The observations represent data collected in a country for a given year. The attributes in the final dataset include Year, Country, Incidence (the number of cases per 1,000 people), Deaths (confirmed deaths from malaria), confirmed cases, Region (using WHO Classification), and Global South (whether or not the country is a developing nation - Global North if it is developed), Gross Domestic Product per Capita adjusted for Purchase Power Parity (GDPpcPPP), and average temperature recorded for the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor/patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No, this data is publicly available. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Over what timeframe was the data collected?**\n",
    "\n",
    "2000 to 2013\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is any information missing from individual instances?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An important piece of data missing from the observations is the population of the country at the time the observation was taken. It will therefore be more difficult to draw comparisons between the number of deaths in different countries per a set time period. This will be a limitation in our data analysis. There are certain years throughout where information was not collected, for example, Kenya 2006 - 2010. Because of this, there are some gaps in our graphs and analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collection\n",
    "**What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It was certainly difficult for the WHO to record malaria cases in developing countries as a lack of developed healthcare systems likely led to some cases going unreported. The data therefore represents the cases the WHO was able to record, which can still reveal relative trends assuming the WHO used standardized data collection methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not explicitly stated whether people were involved in the data collection. The data was “reported” and “confirmed,” meaning that it was likely taken and compiled from existing healthcare systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preprocessing/Cleaning:\n",
    "**What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns were taken from different datasets provided by the WHO on malaria incidence, reported confirmed cases and reported deaths. The column Global South was taken through web scraping this [Wikimedia page](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_regional_classification) . This data was converted into a DataFrame, and the DataFrames with the data from each source were combined into one DataFrame. This left us with our final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).**\n",

    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "We “pre registered” two analyses of our data to ensure that we were not selectively choosing analyses that reveal statistically significant results. We did not know whether these analyses would yield interesting results before we performed them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis 1: Multivariable Regression of Temperature, GDP and Malaria Incidence**\n",
    "\n",
    "In phase 3, we committed to create a multivariable linear regression that predicts the incidence of malaria given temperature and GDP by country for the most recent year in our dataset. However, we realized that grouping by regions rather than by country may be more informative as malaria cases are probably more influenced by georgraphy rather than by specific countries. Temperature and GDP by year and country were not variables in the dataset we used for Phase II, but we added those variables to the final dataset. This was to observe the resulting coefficient of the model and draw conclusions based on that. For instance, if the coefficient is large and positive, we could infer that temperature and GDP together correlate with a higher incidence of malaria in most countries. From the evidence gathered, we discuss in our analysis factors that are likely to impact malaria incidence worldwide, such as change in GDP and global warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis 2: K-Means Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "We committed to perform a k-means clustering analysis to discover ways in which the countries in the dataset can be categorized. This involved trying different clusterings with different values of k. A significant result would be that countries with high, medium and low malaria incidence rates share common categoristics, such as region or temperature change. This analysis provided further insight as to what country characteristics may put countries at a higher risk for the spread of malaria."

    "The exploratory analysis revealed a number of trends. First, malaria incidence has been declining worldwide since 2003. Africa has the highest number of deaths among regions, followed by Arab states and then Asia & Pacific. The other regions have almost none. The heatmap shows few noteworthy relationships, however it is worth noting that there is a moderate correlation of 0.14 between number of confirmed cases and average temperature. Given that malaria is transmitted most easily in warm climates, we are actually surprised that this relationship is not stronger. Given that malaria is transmitted most easily in warm climates, we are actually surprised that this relationship is not stronger. With further research on this topic, we were able to determine that Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax (the malaria parasites) and Anopheles gambiae (the vector mosquito) were all near 23-24 degrees celsius (Citation 1). With this, it has been found that higher temperatures would also not be optimal, making the very strong positive correlation we anticipated less reasonable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first analysis, the multivariable regression, revealed a number of relationships relating to malaria incidence. The regression coefficient of the AverageTemperature variable and incidence is 7.89, meaning that for every degree increase in temperature, the incidence of malaria increases by 7.89 on average. Interestingly, the coefficient with GDP and incidence is 0, meaning that the model predicts no relationship between GDP and incidence. This lack of relationship is reflected in our second analysis, where the k-means clustering demonstrated no clear difference between countries regarding malaria incidence based on GDP. This was surprising because our external research indicated a clear connection between these two factors. In our report, it looks that malaria incidence may be dependent on other factors that are more important for successful transmission of malaria vectors, like vegetation, temperature, humidity, and altitude. As follows, a lower GDP doesn't cause higher malaria incidence, but rather lower GDP is a contributing factor that is important for malaria control. ??\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we found a moderate, positive relationship between average country temperature over a year and malaria incidence. Surprisingly, this was a greater predictor of malaria incidence than GDP. These findings indicate that the trend of rising global temperatures may be associated with higher levels of malaria incidence. Better treatment and prevention of the disease may reverse this trend, and it is uplifting to note that malaria has significantly declined since 2003."

    "## Limitations"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Our project is limited in some ways by its broad scope. The topic we chose is relevant across the world, and as we planned our project, we were very eager to include more and more factors (temperature, gdp, etc). As a result,  we had massive amounts of data to analyze and our project became more broad and shallow than deep and narrow. Though the professor encouraged us that this type of project would also be successful, we wish we could have dove deeper into the tangential components as well. For example, if we had unlimited time, we would have done more research to explore outlier values that we discovered. We also would have looked deeper into Africa specifically and broken those numbers down by region. Africa experienced by far the highest levels of malaria cases per capita, and a future study could compare Africa countries that have similar climates that differ by other variables such as GDP or development of their healthcare system. Overall, this is an exciting topic with many avenues for future exploration! \n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation is our K-means analysis. As our attempts indicate, it seems that K-means is not the best method for us to find significant results. As we identified, the relationship is non-linear and there are no clear clusters on our graph. K-means can only cluster data based on their linear relationship, and is not effective in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "A further limitation of the project is that the timeframe of this project only encompasses dates 2000-2013. This is because the most recent data available for GDP and temperature is in 2013, so our dataset could only include records as recent as that year. Additionally, our project could have been stronger if we had been able to incorporate historical data (i.e. including temperatures and malaria stats from past centuries). This way we could have looked at how changing temperatures through global warming have impacted malaria over the years. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general sense, the nature of the structure of the project was somewhat limited. Instead of designing a study to answer our research question, we had to shape our project based on the data we could find that addressed the question. In this way, the available data played a bigger role in the direction of our project than we would have liked. If we were able to take ownership of the data collection, we also would have a better understanding of data collection methods, making explanations of outliers easier. \n",
